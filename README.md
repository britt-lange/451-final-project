# 451-final-project

## Abstract

Machine Learning can be used to perform high-level operations on many types of quantitative and categorical data, but what happens if the kind of raw data we're studying is not numerical in its truest form? My project aims to consider the ways in which music has been and can be transformed into data and used for machine learning techniques such as classification and regression. How can art such as music be quantified for mathematical operations, and what is lost in the process? I will sift through numerous machine learning studies performed with music as data to examine how each model transforms musical components into computer-readable data, evaluate how the integrity of the music remains intact, and consider the ways in which machine learning models fall short in their interpretation and representation of music as data. 

## Motivation

Music is a unique art form for which there exist rules that could be said to resemble mathematics; chord progressions within keys have roman numeral identities, chords have qualities based on the number of steps between each note, rhythms are written to follow a consistent, numerable meter, and pitches exist on octave scales. While human production of music employs creativity, human feelings and experiences, and evokes unquantifiable emotion, there exists a formula at the base of any musical production. 

With music streaming platforms developed in recent decades, we now have access to musical data such as Spotify statistics. These stats can tell you your most frequently streamed artists and songs, but they also tell you what mood your music is, or what "vibe" your music taste has. Music is used as data for many modern algorithms, and knowing how these decisions are made with songs as data can shed light on the integrity of these statistics.

## Deliverables

This project will largely take the form of an essay, but as I research I may include images or code snippets of different data representations of music. Because this will be a research essay, there will be no specific metric of success or failure; rather, I will examine each data representation and machine learning model related to music that I find, analyzing the components that it can accurately quantify and identifying elements that are unaccounted for. I will consider my project a success if I can find a kind of scale of effective vs. ineffective methods for measuring music, pointing out qualities in different models that preserve or harm the integrity of the music.

## Resources

I will use GitHub's ample library of projects to find example projects to study in my exploration. One example is this GTZAN Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) that converts audio files to spectrograms that feed into Neural Networks. The Python library "librosa" is also used in projects to process audio data via conversion to spectrograms; I will examine several studies that use this library.

## What I Will Learn

A goal I have for this course is to connect machine learning topics to my interests. I am very passionate about music, and as a Computer Science major with a Music minor, I have been searching for a way to examine both in the same context. This project will give me an opportunity to research and analyze how an artistic, creative medium such as music can be applied to computer science algorithms. I intend to spend a great deal of time on this project, more than I have with other work in this class, in order to create a comprehensive, sophisticated research essay. 

## Risk Statement

It is possible that there are very few ways to represent music as data, and that spectrograms, which I have already found and begun researching, are totally effective at capturing musical qualities. It could also be possible that there are not as many musical machine learning studies as I am expecting, or that I won't have access to as many datasets as I need to fully expose this topic. I might also need to computationally test some algorithms on datasets to measure their effects, and I may not have the knowledge required to do such in-depth analyses. That said, I will do my best to use all resources available to me to find as much material as I can and dig deep into the qualities of algorithms and data conversion methods. 

## Ethics Statement

My project can benefit computer science learners and machine learning users who are interested in studying music through machine learning techniques. I aim to find effective methods of representing music as data and point out where some methods fall short, and hopefully the people whose projects I am studying could benefit from my analyses in future projects.

Depending on my findings, my project could expose inadequacies with certain data conversion techniques. For example, the Python library "librosa" might not be able to represent musical qualities such as tone, and the creator of this library might be harmed by my exposition. 

While my topic does not touch on a very politically relevant subject, I believe it could make the world a better place. As machine learning algorithms become increasingly complex and are applied to topics that lay outside STEM-related fields, it is important to understand how artifical intelligences can explore and understand non-quantitative media. With technology growing ever more ubiquitous and models learning to produce various forms of media, the populace wonders what human labor fields will remain standing as artifical intelligence sweeps industries. I believe that by exposing benefits and shortcomings of using music as data, people will understand the human need for art, and that art forms such as music will not be overtaken by computers. 

Understanding how music can best be used as data will help inform music-related machine learning algorithms while also exposing computer science's failures to capture and embody music. 
The world is a better place when people can understand machine learning and artificial intelligence without fearing its power.


## Timeline

In three weeks I plan to have completed my research of machine learning projects and datasets involving music. I will have a wide range of projects and data types to reference in my essay, and I will have organized my research so I know the outline of my essay and what further exploration I need to do. Between three weeks from now and when I will turn in my deliverable and present to the class, I will write the actual essay and perform any experiments I see fit to do.
